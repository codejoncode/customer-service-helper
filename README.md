## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

# üõ† Customer Service Helper

A React + TypeScript app that empowers customer service reps to efficiently handle support calls, ensure all required information is communicated, and auto-generate call documentation for accurate record keeping.

---

## üéØ Purpose

This project was designed to:
- Provide an interactive tool for CSRs (Customer Service Reps) to select a call reason
- Present a checklist of required statements based on internal policy
- Automatically generate templated documentation for copy-pasting into call logs
- Showcase modern front-end coding skills using React, TypeScript, and UI libraries

## üì¶ Tech Stack

- **React** with **TypeScript**
- **Material UI (MUI)** for accessible UI components
- **Zustand** for lightweight global state
- **React Hook Form + Yup** for form management
- **copy-to-clipboard** for one-click documentation copy
- **Day.js** for call timestamps
- **Prettier + ESLint** for code formatting and linting

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/codejoncode/customer-service-helper.git
   cd customer-service-helper

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
