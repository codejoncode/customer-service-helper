Next steps with the testing before adding additional logic

Additional Unit Tests (Component & Logic Isolation)
These target specific functions or component-level logic without requiring real DOM or routing:
- useCallSession
- Ensure verify() doesn't mark as verified if member is undefined
- Confirm reset() works after multiple state updates
- MemberLookup
- Test initial render without crashing
- Validate error display when input is blank
- Confirm setMember() not called on invalid ID
- VerificationModal
- Check each stepâ€™s validation logic independently
- Rejects empty input
- Accepts partial matches if supported
- Validate that verify() is triggered after the final step

ðŸ”— Suggested Integration Tests (Multiple Components + State)
These simulate how components interact and influence shared state or routing:
- Full Verification Flow
- Lookup member ID â†’ open modal â†’ pass all steps â†’ trigger verify() â†’ confirm state
- Failed Verification Loop
- Repeated incorrect inputs at any step keep modal open
- State stays unverified
- Session Reset
- Midway through modal flow, clicking "Cancel" resets useCallSession store
- Routing Trigger
- After successful verification, useNavigate() is called to push /assistant

ðŸŽ¯ Essential User Behavior Tests (Simulate Real Actions)
These focus on user-driven UI interactions and system reactions:
- Pressing Enter submits input
- Clicking outside the modal closes it
- Focusing and navigating with tab keys
- Copy-paste into fields doesnâ€™t break validation
- Typing before lookup fails (no modal should appear)
- Timed inactivity triggers reset (if such a feature is planned)
- Voiceover or screen reader accessibility roles exist (for high accessibility compliance)
